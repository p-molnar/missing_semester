# Exercises

All classes in this course are accompanied by a series of exercises. Some give
you a specific task to do, while others are open-ended, like "try using X and Y
programs". We highly encourage you to try them out.

We have not written solutions for the exercises. If you are stuck on anything
in particular, feel free to send us an email describing what you've tried so
far, and we will try to help you out.

 1. For this course, you need to be using a Unix shell like Bash or ZSH. If you
    are on Linux or macOS, you don't have to do anything special. If you are on
    Windows, you need to make sure you are not running cmd.exe or PowerShell;
    you can use [Windows Subsystem for
    Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or a Linux virtual
    machine to use Unix-style command-line tools. To make sure you're running
    an appropriate shell, you can try the command `echo $SHELL`. If it says
    something like `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`, that means you're running the
    right program.
 1. Create a new directory called `missing` under `/tmp`.
 1. Look up the `touch` program. The `man` program is your friend.
 1. Use `touch` to create a new file called `semester` in `missing`.
 1. Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
    ```
    The first line might be tricky to get working. It's helpful to know that
    `#` starts a comment in Bash, and `!` has a special meaning even within
    double-quoted (`"`) strings. Bash treats single-quoted strings (`'`)
    differently: they will do the trick in this case. See the Bash
    [quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html)
    manual page for more information.
 1. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (`./semester`)
    into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn't work by
    consulting the output of `ls` (hint: look at the permission bits of the
    file).
 1. Run the command by explicitly starting the `sh` interpreter, and giving it
    the file `semester` as the first argument, i.e. `sh semester`. Why does
    this work, while `./semester` didn't?
 1. Look up the `chmod` program (e.g. use `man chmod`).
 1. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than
    having to type `sh semester`. How does your shell know that the file is
    supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? See this page on the
    [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line for more
    information.
 1. Use `|` and `>` to write the "last modified" date output by
    `semester` into a file called `last-modified.txt` in your home
    directory.
 1. Write a command that reads out your laptop battery's power level or your
    desktop machine's CPU temperature from `/sys`. Note: if you're a macOS
    user, your OS doesn't have sysfs, so you can skip this exercise.
